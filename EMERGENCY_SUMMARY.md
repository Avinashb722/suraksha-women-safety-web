## 📋 Emergency Message Created
```
🚨 EMERGENCY: Abhishek Kumar needs help! 
Location: 12.9716, 77.5946 
Maps: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=12.9716,77.5946
```

## 🔧 Current System
1. **Emergency button pressed** → Email sent automatically
2. **SMS contacts displayed** → Manual calling/texting required
3. **Emergency logged** → Full tracking in database

## 💰 To Enable Auto-SMS
- **Fast2SMS**: Pay 100 INR minimum
- **Twilio**: Free trial then paid
- **AWS SNS**: Paid service

## 🎯 Recommendation
**Keep current system:**
- Emails work perfectly for notifications
- Phone numbers provided for manual emergency calls
- Most reliable approach for emergency situations

## 📱 Alternative: Emergency Calling
Instead of SMS, the app could:
1. Auto-dial emergency contacts
2. Send WhatsApp messages (manual click)
3. Show emergency contact list for quick calling

**Reality: Email notifications + manual phone calls = Most reliable emergency system**
